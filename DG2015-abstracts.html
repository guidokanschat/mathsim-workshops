      <h3>Bernardo Cockburn: The evolution of the HDG methods</h3>

    <p>
      After motivating the introduction of the so-called hybridizable
      discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, we give an overview of
      their development since their inception. This will be done in
      the framework of steady-state diffusion problems. Extensions to
      other problems will be also reviewed.

    <h3>Blanca Ayuso de Dios: Auxiliary Space Preconditioners for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of H(curl)-elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients.</h3>

    <p>
      We introduce a family of preconditioners for linear systems of
      equations arising from a symmetric Interior Penalty
      Discontinuous Galerkin (IP-DG) discretization of
      H<sup>curl</sup>(Ω)-elliptic boundary value problems.  The
      design and analysis of the preconditioners relies on the
      auxiliary space method (ASM) employing an auxiliary space of
      H<sup>curl</sup>(Ω)-conforming finite element functions together
      with a relaxation technique. We analyze the asymptotic
      convergence of the proposed preconditioners addressing
      specifically the robustness of the solvers with respect to jumps
      in the coefficients of the second and zeroth order parts of the
      operator, respectively.  Extensive numerical experiments are
      included to verify the theory and asses the performance of the
      preconditioners.

    <h3>Peter Bastian: High-performance Computing for Flows in Porous Media</h3>
    <p>
      Simulation of flow and transport processes in porous media
      provides a formidable challenge and application field for
      high-performance computing.  Relevant continuum-scale models
      include partial differential equations of elliptic, parabolic
      and hyperbolic type which are coupled through highly nonlinear
      coefficient functions. The multi-scale character and
      uncertainties in the parameters constitute an additional level
      of complexity but provide also opportunities for
      high-performance computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk will focus on the efficient solution of porous media
      flow problems with discontinuous Galerkin methods.  For the fast
      solution of the linear systems arising in the elliptic flow
      equation a hybrid preconditioner based on subspace correction in
      the conforming finite element subspace is employed. The
      transport equation is solved with explicit methods as part of an
      operator splitting scheme for the coupled system. The
      performance of the implementation based on the sum factorization
      approach is assessed and computational results for unstable
      flows in porous media are presented.

    <h3>Jay Gopalakrishnan: Six formulations of the Maxwell cavity problem and their DPG discretizations</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on how each equation in the Maxwell system is treated
      (weakly or strongly), one gets a proliferation of variational
      formulations for a single electric cavity boundary value
      problem. We will show that stability of one variational
      formulation implies the stability of all others. Then we discuss
      the stability of their DPG discretizations.
    </p>

    <h3>Chen Greif: On Nonsingular Saddle-Point Systems with a Maximally Rank-Deficient Leading Block</h3>
    <p>
      My collaboration with Dominik started over ten years ago, when
      we considered preonditioners for the saddle-point formulation of
      the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The mathematical problem is
      fascinating, and the discrete Helmholtz equation does magic that
      allowed us to develop an effective block preconditioner, and
      some matrix analysis to go along with it. It's been fun to work
      together ever since. Recently, my student Ron Estrin and I have
      taken a broader look at the algebraic properties of the class of
      nonsingular saddle-point matrices whose leading block is
      maximally rank deficient, and have found that the inverse in
      this case has unique mathematical properties. This allows for
      developing a class of indefinite block preconditioners that rely
      on approximating the null space of the leading block. The
      preconditioned matrix is a product of two indefinite matrices,
      but under certain conditions the conjugate gradient method can
      be applied and is rapidly convergent. Spectral properties of the
      preconditioners are observed and validated by numerical
      experiments.

    <h3>Marcus Grote: DG Methods and Multi-level Local Time-Stepping For Wave Propagation</h3>
    <p>
      The accurate and reliable simulation of wave phenomena is of
      fundamental importance in a wide range of engineering and
      medical applications such as seismic tomography, wireless
      communication, ultrasound imaging, and non-invasive testing. To
      address the wide range of difficulties involved, we consider
      symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IP-DG)
      methods for the wave equation (Grote, Schneebeli, Schötzau,
      2006, 2009), which easily handle elements of various types and
      shapes, irregular non-matching grids, and even locally varying
      polynomial order. Moreover, in contrast to standard (conforming)
      finite element methods, IP-DG methods yield an essentially
      diagonal mass matrix; hence, when coupled with explicit time
      integration, the overall numerical schemes remain truly explicit
      in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local mesh refinement severely impedes the efficiency of
      explicit time-stepping methods for numerical wave
      propagation. Local time-stepping (LTS) methods overcome the
      bottleneck due to a few small elements by allowing smaller
      time-steps precisely where those elements are located. Yet when
      the region of local mesh refinement itself contains a sub-region
      of even smaller elements, any local time-step again will be
      overly restricted. To remedy the repeated bottleneck caused by
      hierarchical mesh refinement, multilevel local time-stepping
      methods are proposed, which permit the use of the appropriate
      time-step at every level of mesh refinement. Based on the LTS
      methods from Diaz and Grote (2009), these multi-level LTS
      methods are explicit, yield arbitrarily high accuracy and
      conserve the energy.

    <h3>Ralf Hiptmair: Discretizing the Advection of Differential Forms</h3>
    <p>
      Motivated by boundary value problems from magneto-hydrodynamics
      we study advection problems for differential forms. They are
      stated in terms of the Lie derivative in a given velocity
      field. They also represent a family of transport problems, of
      which scalar advection is one member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by successful schemes devised for the scalar case we
      pursue a stabilized Galerkin approach in the spirit of
      discontinuous Galerkin methods with upwind numerical flux. We
      note that even if the solution is approximated by means of
      discrete differential forms, jump terms across interelement
      faces have to be retained for non-scalar problems, and they hold
      the key to stability. Rigorous a priori convergence estimate are
      provided for the stationary problem and for Lipschitz continuous
      velocity fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      For discontinuous velocities, existence of solutions of is open
      beyond the scalar case. However, an extension of a stabilized
      Galerkin scheme performs well in numerical experiments also in
      this case.
    </p>
    <h3>Paul Houston: Adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin Methods on Polytopic Meshes</h3>
    <p>
      In this talk we consider the hp-version interior penalty
      discontinuous Galerkin method (DGFEM) for the discretization of
      second order elliptic partial differential equations on general
      computational meshes consisting of polygonal/polyhedral
      elements. By admitting such general meshes, this class of
      methods allows for the approximation of problems posed on com-
      putational domains which may contain a huge number of local
      geometrical features, or micro-structures. While standard
      numerical methods can be de- vised for such problems, the
      computational effort may be extremely high, as the minimal
      number of elements needed to represent the underlying domain can
      be very large. In contrast, the minimal dimension of the
      underlying (composite) finite element space based on general
      polytopic meshes is inde- pendent of the number of geometric
      features. Here, we consider both the a priori and a posteriori
      error analysis of this class of methods, as well as their
      application within Schwarz-type domain decomposition
      preconditioners.

      (Durham).

    <h3>Guido Kanschat: On the finite element cochain complex for divergence conforming DG methods for Stokes equations</h3>
    
    <h3>Markus Melenk: hp-FEM for singular perturbations: balanced
norms and multiple scales</h3>
    <p>
      We consider the approximation of solutions of singularly
      perturbed elliptic equations. Two classes are studied.  The
      first class consists of elliptic-elliptic problems.  There, the
      classical Galerkin approximation is optimal in the so-called
      energy norm, which is, however, so weak that features within the
      layer are not well resolved.  We show that robust exponential
      convergence of a high order FEM on suitable meshes is achieved
      also in a stronger, ``balanced'' norm. This latter norm is
      balanced in the sense that layer contributions are of size
      $O(1)$ uniformly in the perturbation parameter. The second class
      consists of systems of singularly perturbed ODEs of
      elliptic-hyperbolic type with multiple scales. We discuss
      well-posedness of the variational formulations and robust
      convergence of an $h$-version Discontinuous Galerkin method on
      Shishkin meshes.
    </p>

    <h3>Peter Minev: High-order Artificial Compressibility for the Navier-Stokes Equations</h3>
    <p>
      We introduce a generalization of the artificial compressibility
      method for approximation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
      equations. It allows for the construction of schemes of any
      order in time that require the solution of a fixed number of
      vectorial parabolic problems, depending only on the desired
      order of the scheme. These problems have a condition number that
      scales like <i>k h<sup>-2</sup></i>, with k
      being the time step and h being the spatial grid size.  This
      approach has several advantages in comparison to the traditional
      pro- jection schemes widely used for the unsteady Navier-Stokes
      equations. First, it allows for the construction of schemes of
      any order for both, the veloc- ity and pressure, while the best
      proven accuracy achievable by a projection scheme is second
      order on the velocity and 3/2 order on the pressure. Second, the
      projection schemes require the solution of an elliptic scalar
      problem for the pressure that has a condition number
      of order <i>h<sup>-2</sup></i> in addition to a vectorial parabolic
      problem for the velocity. This makes them slower if iterative
      meth- ods are used to solve the linear systems. Third, the
      artificial compressibility schemes of second or higher order
      based on a defect correction approach pre- sented below have
      superior stability properties as compared to a second order
      projection scheme. Finally, we will discuss the approach for
      solving the linear system resulting from the momentum equation
      and more particularly, we will present an unconditionally stable
      scheme that treats the mixed derivatives in the grad div
      operator fully explicitly.

    <h3>Peter Monk: Generalized Plane Waves and Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Following both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical
      testing, Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) methods have shown
      promise for efficiently solving time harmonic wave equations
      including the Helmholtz equation, Maxwell?s equations and Liner
      Elasticity.  However, one drawback is that coefficients
      describing the physical medium (for example, refractive index)
      need to be piecewise constant.  In some applications spatially
      dependent coefficients are encountered.  In this talk I shall
      describe a technique for generating approximate local solutions
      of the Helmholtz equation with non-constant coefficients called
      Generalized Plane Waves. To use these functions with TDG
      requires a generalization of the standard TDG scheme.  An error
      analysis will be described and numerical examples will be
      presented.

    <h3>Nilima Nigam: Localized activation and intramuscular fat in muscle: an investigating using DG methods</h3>
    <p>
      The response of the muscle-tissue unit (MTU) to activation and
      applied forces is affected by the architectural details as well
      as the material properties of this nearly-incompressible
      tissue. We will describe the (highly nonlinear) elastic
      equations governing this response for a fully three-dimensional,
      quasi-static, fully nonlinear and anisotropic MTU. We describe a
      three-field formulation for this problem, and present a DG
      discretization strategy. The scheme was implemented using {\tt
      deal.ii}. We present computational results about the effects of
      localized activation as well as the effects of fatty tissue on
      muscle response. This is joint with Sebastian Dominguez, Hadi
      Rahemi, David Ryan and James Wakeling.
    </p>

    <h3>Ricardo Oyarzua: Augmented mixed-FEM for Navier-Stokes and related problems in Fluid Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
      In this talk we present a new mixed-type finite element method
      for the Navier-Stokes problem. This new method is based on the
      introduction of a modified pseudostress tensor depending
      nonlinearly on the velocity through the respective convective
      term. The pressure is eliminated by using the incompressibility
      condition. Next, the equations are augmented with Galerkin type
      terms arising from the constitutive and equilibrium equations,
      and from the Dirichlet boundary condition. In this way, we
      propose an augmented mixed method for the fluid flow problem
      where the only unknowns are given by the aforementioned modified
      pseudostress and the velocity. Further variables of interest,
      such as the fluid pressure, the fluid vorticity and the fluid
      velocity gradient, can be easily approximated as a simple
      postprocess of the finite element solutions with the same rate
      of convergence. Then, the classical Banach’s fixed point Theorem
      and Lax-Milgram’s Lemma are applied to prove well-posedness of
      the continuous problem. Similarly, we establish well-posedness
      and the corresponding Cea’s estimate of the associated Galerkin
      scheme considering any conforming finite element subspace for
      each unknown. In particular, the associated Galerkin scheme can
      be defined by employing Raviart-Thomas elements of degree k for
      the nonlinear-pseudostress tensor, and continuous piecewise
      polynomial elements of degree k + 1 for the velocity, which
      leads to an optimal convergent scheme. Finally, we extend our
      analysis to the Navier-Stokes problem with variable viscosity
      and the Boussinesq equations.

    <h3>Ilaria Perugia: Space-time Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods for wave problems</h3>
    <p>
      A space-time discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation
      problems will be presented and analysed. The special feature of
      the scheme is that it is a Trefftz method, namely that trial and
      test functions are solution of the partial differential equation
      to be discretised in each element of the (space-time) mesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      For acoustic and electromagnetic wave equations in one space
      dimension, we prove stability of the method, quasi-optimality,
      best approximation estimates for polynomial Trefftz spaces, and
      high order error bounds in the meshwidth and in the polynomial
      degree.  The analysis framework also applies to the case of
      higher space dimensions. Some numerical experiments demonstrate
      the theoretical results and the faster convergence compared to
      the non-Trefftz version of the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      These results have been obtained in collaboration with Fritz
      Kretzschmar (TU Darmstadt), Andrea Moiola (University of
      Reading), and Sascha M. Schnepp (ETH Zurich).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Francisco-Javier Sayas: Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Elastodynamics</h3>
    <p>
      In this talk I will present some preliminary results on the use
      of an HDG method for the simulation of elastic waves. I will
      show how the Qiu and Shi choice of spaces and stabilization
      parameters for an HDG scheme applied to quasi-static elasticity
      also apply for time harmonic elastic waves, providing a
      superconvergent method. I will next discuss a conservation of
      energy property that holds in the transient case when the
      elasticity equations are semidiscretized in space with the same
      HDG strategy.
    </p>

      This work is a collaboration with Allan Hungria (University of
      Delaware) and Daniele Prada (Indiana University Purdue
      University at Indianapolis)

    <h3>Rolf Stenberg: On the error analysis of the stabilized finite element methods for the Stokes problem</h3>
    <p>
      We consider stabilized mixed finite element methods for the
      Stokes problem. Previous error analysis of these methods have
      assumed that the solution is smooth. Using a technique of
      T. Gudi we now derive a quasioptimal error estimate, i.e. we
      show that the error is bounded by the interpolation error and an
      data oscillation term. In addition, we derive an residual based
      a posteriori error.
    </p>
    <h3>Thomas Wihler: Discontinuous Galerkin Time Stepping Methods for Nonlinear Initial Value Problems with Finite Time Blow-Up</h3>
    <p>
      We consider continuous and discontinuous Galerkin time stepping
      methods of arbitrary order as applied to nonlinear initial value
      problems in real Hilbert spaces. We develop new techniques to
      prove general Peano-type existence results for discrete
      solutions. In particular, our results show that the existence of
      solutions is independent of the local approximation order, and
      only requires the local time steps to be sufficiently small
      (independent of the polynomial degree). The uniqueness of
      (local) solutions is addressed as well. In addition, our theory
      is applied to finite time blow-up problems with nonlinearities
      of algebraic growth. For such problems we develop an adaptive
      time step algorithm for the purpose of numerically computing the
      blow-up time, and provide a convergence result.
